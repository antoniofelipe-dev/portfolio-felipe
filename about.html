            <p>My name is Antonio Felipe, I was born in Teresina-PI and I'm 18 years old. I currently work at a Moto Parts company, where I work in the tecnology department managing the ERP software used by us, the TOTVS. In my role, little programming is used, but it is needed to create automations solutions that facilitate repetitive daily processes, with the creation of scripts being feasible. At these times, python is my main ally, due to its wide variety of modules, making it possible to automate almost everything.
